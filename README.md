This repository demonstrates a common numeric overflow bug in COBOL and its solution. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The bug arises from insufficiently sized numeric variables and the lack of robust error handling. The solution involves using a larger numeric variable to accommodate larger values and providing explicit overflow checks and handling.
